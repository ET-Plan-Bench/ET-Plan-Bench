## Installation
To install the VirtualHome v2.3.0 simulator, please refer to https://github.com/xavierpuigf/virtualhome. Feel free to pull the whole github repo inside folder "/simulator"

To supervised fine-tune (SFT) LLM, please refer to https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA. To transfer generated data to the data format for SFT, please refer to https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/Finetune_Custom_Data.md. We utilized the text-only component of LLaVA-1.5, which has been fine-tuned from LLAMA2

All packages required are included in environment.txt.
